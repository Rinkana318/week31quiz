<h1>Max Taylor Period 4 Advanced Web Development</h1>

<h2>My Favorite Part of Advanced Web</h2>
<p>My favorite part of Advanced Web is the projects we have worked on so far. 
It was a lot of fun making a game with my classmates. I like on how relaxed the 
class is I never get overwhelmed with work.</p>

<h2>My Least Favorite Part of Advanced Web</h2>
<p>The work is a little too easy. We spend a lot of our time not really working
just debugging other students code. I don't have to put my full attention into 
the class and im still able to get everything done.</p>
