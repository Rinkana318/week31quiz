        <h2>My Favorite Part of Advanced Web</h2>
        <p>My favorite part of Advanced Web is the projects we have worked on so far. 
        It was a lot of fun making a game with my classmates. I like on how relaxed the 
        class is I never get overwhelmed with work.</p>
        
        <h2>My Least Favorite Part of Advanced Web</h2>
        <p>The work is a little too easy. We spend a lot of our time not really working
        just debugging other students code. I don't have to put my full attention into 
        the class and im still able to get everything done.</p>
